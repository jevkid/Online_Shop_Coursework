First Web Coursework
====
This was the first assignment in the module Web Applications for the first year at Cardiff University. We were required to create and code an online shop of some sort where the user could browse items, sort them using different categories, add them to a basket, remove them from the basket, change the quantity, and check out. We were not required to implement a payment method.
